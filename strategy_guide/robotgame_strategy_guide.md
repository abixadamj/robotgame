#Robot Game strategy guide
by ramk13

##Introduction

The purpose of this strategy guide is to help people get started on bots more advanced than the example bot. It took me a while to make a decent bot while learning python at the same time. What helped me a lot was to look at open source bots and look at the different ways that people had approached the same problem. There are lots of ways to code a good bot, and this is just one.

Feel free to use the code in this guide in your bots, but please don't copy and paste a whole bot with no changes. That isn't learning or improving, it's just copying. Attribution would be appreciated if you use significant portions of code. I'll say that I learned a lot from many of the open source bots on [mpeterv's github](https://github.com/mpeterv/robotgame-bots) including his bot, [liquid 1.0](https://robotgame.net/robot/7913).

If you have a local machine that you can run python on, I highly suggest you install [rgkit](https://github.com/WhiteHalmos/rgkit) so you can do offline testing without having to paste your code to the server every time. It'll make improving a lot faster. I'll put together a list of other tools and suggestions for improving soon.

##The guides

* The [documentation](https://robotgame.net/api) which includes [Getting Started](https://robotgame.net/gettingstarted) - [final code - Example Bot](https://github.com/ramk13/robotgame/blob/master/strategy_guide/strategy-example.py)
  * If you haven't visited these pages, take a look here first. The game rules, Robot Game python library are described and an example bot is included to get you started.
* [Basic Strategy](https://github.com/ramk13/robotgame/blob/master/strategy_guide/robotgame_basic_strategy.md) - [final code](https://github.com/ramk13/robotgame/blob/master/strategy_guide/strategy-basic.py)
  * We take the example bot and add features/concepts to improve how it plays. We also take a look at using sets for storing our bots and possible moves
* Intermediate Strategy (Work in Progress)
