#Robotgame strategy guide
by ramk13

##Introduction

The purpose of this strategy guide is to help people get started on bots more advanced than the example bot. It took me a while to make a decent bot while learning python at the same time. What helped me a lot was to look at open source bots and look at the different ways that people had approached the same problem. There are lots of ways to code a good bot, and this is just one.

Feel free to use the code in this guide in your bots, but please don't copy and paste a whole bot with no changes. That isn't learning or improving, it's just copying. Attribution would be appreciated if you use significant portions of code. I'll say that I learned a lot from many of the open source bots on [mpeterv's github](https://github.com/mpeterv/robotgame-bots) including his bot, [liquid 1.0](https://robotgame.net/robot/7913).

If you have a local maching you can run python on, I highly suggest you install [rgkit](https://github.com/WhiteHalmos/rgkit) so you can do offline testing without having to paste your code to the server every time. It'll make improving a lot faster. I put together a list of other tools and suggestions for improving soon.
